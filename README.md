FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION
This repository implements a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using deep learning with ResNet architecture. The project classifies facial expressions into emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutrality.

Key Features
 - Utilizes ResNet for robust feature extraction and emotion classification.
 - Trained on datasets like FER-2013 for high accuracy.
 - Real-time emotion detection supported using OpenCV and webcam.
 - Built with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.
